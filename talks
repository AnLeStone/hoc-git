Hi

I like reading books about healthcare and spirituality story.
My most favorite book is "Journey to the East", kind of spirituality
This book is a story finding the reason why we live on the Earth, what is ghost, 
what will we become after the death, somethings like that.
It inspire me to improve myself and try to make everything to be better.
I will take a break from my work at the end of this year.
And I intend to do some meaningful works at that time to live slower
and lookback to my life :D

to develop leadership for young people. They provide young people a chance

This is the first time I apply to go to other countries.
I dont know clearly what I will face
But I have an allergic reaction with some seafood and red meat.
I think it may be uncomfortable for everyone if I dont want to eat these kind of food.
Especially if they are available in tranditional food.
There is only 1 thing. I think.

Have you had any experience in this field 
(teaching, photography, writing, etc.)?
I have join to a resemble activity when I was at the university.
I come to the nursing home and clean this place.
Talked with elderly people and give them some cake.
But the activity was hold in a short time. Only in the afternoon.
So we did not done many works.

Have you join any voluntary activities before? 
Can you tell us more detail about this?

I have joined a program about raising awareness for poor children.
This program aims to go to the poor school in small villages
to create somethings like a knowledge fair, enhance school facility, 
and take care around environment.
We often have 3 days for these activities.
And we will prepare for these activities around 1-2 months at the university.
Then we will ride bikes around 30-50 km to come to target place.

The first day will be upgraded facility and decorate for job fair.
The second day will be knowledge fair.
The last day will clean our battlefield to finish the program.

The fair will have many booths, which contains knowledge in many fields
like cooking, take care the health, protect the environment, 
encourage children dare to dream, teaching computer skill, somethings like that.

I learn how to teamwork for one target.
after the program there is no perfection, every mistake is a lesson. 
If I afraid the mistake, I may make bigger mistakes :v 
My brain cannot generate memory any more :v 


What will you do if there are struggles between you 
and your teammates/among your teammates?
I'll keep silence until I am calm down.
Then I will ask teammate a chance to explain or say sorry.
If teammate does not have any idea to reconcile.
I will keep silence to enjoy my works and try not to affect her or him.
